# container-chain
Using the more abstracted layer of app development through docker containers and developing alternative communication infrastructures such as rabbitmq ( microservices), AWS or an automated database integration tool for integrating transaction data such as Insurance data, EMR, EHRs and other business use cases. Essentially we will try to build a really simple DApp on hyperledger or ethereum for connecting docker containers and transferring local data between containers ( usually SQL table dumps or JSON whereby it is the future input for ML or other AI tasks or for research in finance and stocks )
